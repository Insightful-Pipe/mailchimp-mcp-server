## Control What Your AI Can Do

You decide what AI agents can do with each connected account:

- **Turn individual actions on or off** for every connected account, so agents only see the actions you allow.
- **Connect as Read-only or Read & Write.** A read-only connection can only enable read actions.
- **Destructive actions stay off by default.** Actions such as deletes are disabled until an admin enables them.
- **Team access per account.** Restricted team members only use the accounts they are granted, with the read actions enabled on them.

## Usage Examples

```
"Show open and click rates for my last 5 campaigns"
```

```
"How has my audience grown this year?"
```

```
"Create a segment of subscribers who opened the last campaign"
```
